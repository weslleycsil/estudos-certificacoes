# 3 Installing and Configuring ESXi

## 1. Installing and Configuring ESXi

Learner Objectives

- Describe the ESXi host architecture
- Navigate the Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) to configure an ESXi host
- Recognize the user account best practices
- Install an ESXi host
- Configure the ESXi host settings

### About ESXi

ESXi is a bare-metal hypervisor that is licensed as a part of vSphere.

- High Security
    - Host-based firewall
    - Memory Hardening
    - Kernel module integrity
    - Trusted Platform Module (TPM 2.0)
    - UEFI secure boot
    - Encrypted core dumps
- Small Dis footprint
- Quick boot
- Installable on hard disks, SAN LUNs, SSD, SATADOM, and diskless hosts

### ESXi 8.0 Installation Requirements

- Supported server platform
- At least two CPU cores
- At least 8 GB of physical RAM, 12 GB for a production environment
- One or more Gigabit or faster Ethernet controllers
- Boot disk of at least 32 GB of persistent storage

### Configuring an ESXi Host

The **DCUI** is a text-based user interface with keyboard-only interaction.

Use the **DCUI** to configure management network settings:

- Network adapter selection
- VLAN ID
- IPv4 and IPv6 configuration (IP address, subnet mask, default gateway)
- Host name
- DNS servers and suffixes

Use the **DCUI** to configure the root access settings:

- Change the root password (complex passwords only)
- Activate or deactivate the lockdown mode:
    - Limits the management of the host to vCenter
    - Can be configured only for hosts managed by a vCenter instance

Using the **DCUI**, you can configure the keyboard layout, activate troubleshooting services, view support information, and view system logs.

Using the **DCUI** you can enable/disable ESXi Shell and SSH.

### Time Synchronization for the ESXi Host

Time synchronization is important:
- For accurate performance graphs
- For accurate time stamps in log messages
- So that virtual machines have a source to synchronize

You can use the time synchronization options:
- Manual configuration
- NTP, Network Time Protocol, providing millisecond timing accuracy
- PTP, Precision Time Protocol, providing microsecond timing accuracy

**You can configure NTP or PTP using VMware Host Client or the vSphere Client**.

**NTP** client uses UDP over **port 123**.
**PTP** client uses UDP over **ports 319 and 320**.
You can use NTP as a fallback if the PTP service does not work.

## Key Points

- The Direct Console User Interface (DCUI) allows you to configure certain settings for ESXi hosts.
- Securing the root user account is very important to secure an ESXi host, as the user is the host's most powerful user.
- NTP provides millisecond timing accuracy and PTP provides microsecond timing accuracy for ESXi hosts.
