## Traditional Data Center Security

The landscape of the modern data center is changing at a phenomenal speed. Workloads were rapidly migrated from physical to virtualized to software-defined data centers. Today, you must adapt to multicloud environments, mobile devices, and new architectures such as microservices and containers.

These advances are not without risks because security often becomes an afterthought. Securing and managing all these moving pieces by using traditional security approaches is becoming increasingly complex. A strong defense is not enough only at the perimeter. Modern attacks might target your internal infrastructure by compromising one of your virtual machines and spreading through your data center.

You need an approach to protect all the traffic in the data center and to consistently protect its changing components.

NSX micro-segmentation resolves the security challenges of the modern data center.

## About Micro-Segmentation

NSX Micro-Segmentation addresses the challenges of traditional data center security.

While traditional data center security policies are applied to the infrastructure, NSX micro-segmentation establishes a security perimeter around each VM or container workload with dynamically defined policies. NSX micro-segmentation allows security administrators to build security controls for each individual workload based on its application requirements.

### Traditional Data Center Security

Traditional data centers pose many security challenges:
- Traditional security policies align with the environment rather than with applications. The security is typically placed at the perimeter of the data center and not in the applications.
- Shared services, such as DNS and Active Directory services, can traverse the application tier boundaries without being checked.
- Traditional segmentation does not prevent lateral communication between workloads in a tier. For example, all virtual machines or containers in the web services tier can freely communicate with each other.
- Attackers can move freely around the data center and access valuable data, after penetrating the environment.

### NSX Micro-Segmentation

Micro-segmentation provides several functions and benefits:
- Logically divides the data center into distinct security segments at the individual virtual machine and container level
- Limits lateral movement in the data center
- Minimizes risks and the effect of security breaches
- Uses the existing networking infrastructure
