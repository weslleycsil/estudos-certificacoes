- Implement DNS in NSX-T Data Center

## Use Case for DNS

The users of VMBeans cannot remember the IP address of the webpage every time they place an order for coffee. So, the company uses a friendly name, such as vmbeans.com, instead of the IP address.

Computers find and communicate with each other over the Internet by using their IP addresses. Computers can use both IP version 4 addresses, such as 93.184.216.34, and IP version 6 addresses, such as 2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946. Humans prefer easy-to-remember domain names such as vmbeans.com or vmware.com.

DNS resolves computer names (vmbeans.com) to IP addresses (172.20.10.10), and conversely.

DNS is like a phone book for the Internet. When a user or computer wants to connect to another computer by using its name, a lookup request is sent to a DNS server. The DNS server responds with the IP address.

## Implementing DNS in NSX-T Data Center

A DNS server resolves computer names to IP addresses. The public DNS servers on the Internet are like the Internet's phone book. The public DNS servers resolve computer and website names to public IP addresses. In addition, most organizations maintain internal DNS servers that resolve computer names to private IP addresses that are used in that organization.

A DNS forwarder is a server that forwards local DNS requests from clients to external DNS servers. The DNS forwarder caches the responses received from the external DNS servers, so that it can service subsequent requests without reaching the external DNS server. This method improves system performance and hides internal DNS information from external networks.

NSX-T Data Center Tier-1 and Tier-0 gateways can be configured as DNS forwarders.
