## Virtual Switches Overview

### About Virtual Networking

Virtual networking enables devices across many locations to function with the same capabilities as a traditional physical network.

Physical networking connects computers through cables and network hardware devices. Virtual networking extends the physical networking capabilities by using network virtualization platforms to connect workloads regardless of their physical location. This method allows data centers to stretch across different locations and enables network administrators to easily modify the network without buying more hardware.

Virtual networking uses software-based versions of traditional network devices, such as switches and routers, enabling a more efficient network configuration. This method results in greater flexibility in provisioning networks to meet the specific application needs.

Using virtual networking, you can create virtual networks in the region where a sale takes place to cope with the demand. Additional hardware is not necessary.


### Virtual Switches

#### About Virtual Switches

A virtual switch is at the heart of a virtual network.

A virtual switch works like a physical switch in a physical network.

VMware vSphere® has two types of virtual switches: standard switches and distributed switches.

##### Using a Traditional Physical Network

![Virtual Networking Physical Machines](../../images/VirtualNetworking_PhysicalMachines.svg)
A traditional physical network connects physical machines through a physical switch, physical cables, and other physical hardware.

##### Using a Virtual Network

A virtual network uses software versions of traditional network devices. These virtual devices are called virtual hardware.

##### Using a Virtual Switch
![](../../images/VirtualSwitch_NetworkTraffic.png)

A virtual switch controls and directs communication between the virtual parts of the network. A virtual switch detects which virtual machines are connected to its virtual ports and forwards traffic to the correct virtual machines.

This traffic exists as network packets or data packets. A virtual switch checks the data packets and forwards them to their destination.

#### Virtual Switch Connections

To connect VMs and ESXi hosts to the network, a virtual switch uses specific types of connections, or ports:
- Virtual machine
- VMkernel
- Uplink

##### Port Types

###### Virtual Machine Ports

Virtual machine ports connect virtual machines to the virtual network.

###### VMkernel Port

VMkernel ports are used by the ESXi hypervisor (VMkernel) for managing ESXi system traffic.

###### Uplink Ports

Uplink ports connect the virtual network to the physical network.

Each uplink port is associated with a physical network adapter on the ESXi host.

### Connecting VMs to the Network

A VM uses a virtual switch to connect to the network.

#### Virtual NIC

![](../../images/VMNetworking_VirtualNIC2.svg)

A virtual machine has a virtual network adapter, also called virtual NIC(*Network Interface Card*).

The virtual NIC is configured to connect to a virtual machine port group, for example, Production.

When a virtual machine is powered on, the virtual NIC connects to a virtual port in the virtual machine port group.

#### VM Port Group

![](../../images/VMNetworking_PortGroups2.svg)

A virtual switch can have one or more port groups and can be used to logically group similar VMs.
VMs can communicate with other VMs in the same port group and in different port groups.

#### Uplink Ports

![](../../images/VMNetworking_UplinkPorts.png)

When a VM must communicate with a computer on the physical network, the uplink ports pass traffic from the VM to the physical network adapters that they are associated with.

#### Physical Network

![](../../images/VMNetworking_PhysicalSwitch.png)

The physical network adapters on the ESXi host are connected to the physical switch, which is connected to the physical network.

With this setup, a VM can communicate with a computer or device on the physical network.

### VMkernel Port

The ESXi host connects to the network by using a VMkernel port, also called the VMkernel adapter.

A VMkernel port manages network traffic for ESXi, such as management traffic, IP storage traffic, and so on.

#### Management Traffic

You can use a VMkernel port to control the management traffic. Management traffic refers to the communication between vCenter Server and the ESXi hosts that it manages.

For example, a user powers on a VM by using the VMware vSphere® Client™. To perform the task of powering on the VM, VMware vCenter Server® must communicate with the ESXi host where the VM is located.

#### IP Storage Traffic

The storage that an ESXi host uses to store its VMs can be located on the network. This type of storage is called network-attached storage or IP storage. iSCSI and NFS are examples of IP storage.

ESXi uses a VMkernel port to manage traffic between the ESXi host and IP storage, such as an iSCSI storage array, where the host's VMs are stored.

#### Other Types of Traffic

VMkernel ports also manage other types of traffic:

##### VMware vSphere® vMotion®
This traffic flows between ESXi hosts. vSphere vMotion is a feature used to move a virtual machine from one host to another.

##### VMware vSAN™
This traffic flows between hosts in a vSAN cluster. vSAN is a cluster feature that combines the direct-attached storage of ESXi hosts to create a datastore on which VMs are stored.

##### VMware vSphere® Fault Tolerance
This traffic flows between the primary ESXi host and secondary ESXi host in a vSphere Fault Tolerance configuration. vSphere Fault Tolerance is a cluster feature that provides continuous availability (with no downtime) to virtual machines.

##### VMware vSphere® Replication™
This traffic flows between ESXi hosts. vSphere Replication is a data protections feature that replicates VMs from an ESXi host in the source site to an ESXi in a target site.
