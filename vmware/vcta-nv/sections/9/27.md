## About VMware Virtual Cloud Network

The network of the future is virtualized, distributed, and software-defined. The VMware networking and security portfolio delivers on that future by creating a virtual cloud network that connects and protects applications across private clouds, public clouds, and edge devices.

This solution provides consistent policies across heterogeneous environments, simplified operations, and lower costs. The virtual networking and security capabilities extend to any workload that runs in VMs, containers, or bare-metal servers.
